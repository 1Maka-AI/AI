    "Who:The protagonist is [Alex], a young and ambitious astronaut. [Alex]grew up fascinated by the mysteries of space and had always dreamt of exploring the cosmos. Prior to becoming an astronaut, he worked as an engineer on Earth, where their passion for space exploration was nurtured through years of studying and experimentation.\\n\n",
    "Where:[Alex] and their loyal robotic companion, [Companion], find themselves aboard the ASV(Advanced Space Vessel) Starlight, a state-of-the-art spacecraft, drifting through the vast expanse of interstellar space. \\n\n",
    "The current time is set in the distant future, where humanity has begun its journey beyond the confines of the solar system, venturing into the uncharted territories of the cosmos.\\n\n",
    "Mission:The journey embarked upon by the protagonist was spurred by a monumental discovery made by a team of interstellar researchers. A mysterious signal originating from a distant star system, known only as the \"Stellar Gateway,\" was detected. Eager to unlock the secrets of the universe, [Alex] volunteered for the mission to investigate the source of the signal.\\n\n",
    "What:As the ASV Starlight hurtled through the depths of space, its once pristine exterior was now marred by the scars of a violent cosmic storm. The storm's relentless fury had inflicted damage on multiple critical systems, plunging [Alex] and [Companion] into a perilous struggle for survival.\\n\n",
    "1. Windows shattered, exposing the void: The force of the storm shattered the ship's reinforced windows, sending fractured shards of transparent alloy scattering into the vacuum of space. The breach exposed the crew to the unforgiving cosmic expanse, with only emergency force fields preventing the total loss of atmospheric pressure within the vessel.\\n\n",
    "2. Water circulation system compromised: Within the ship's confines, the delicate balance of life-sustaining resources was thrown into disarray as the water circulation system suffered catastrophic damage. Leaking pipes and ruptured reservoirs caused precious water reserves to evaporate into the void, threatening to leave the crew without the essential resources for survival.\\n\n",
    "3. Power fluctuations plague the propulsion system: The storm's electromagnetic onslaught wreaked havoc on the ship's power distribution network, resulting in erratic fluctuations that crippled the propulsion system. Without a stable power supply, the engines sputtered and faltered, leaving the ASV Starlight adrift amidst the vast expanse of interstellar space.\\n\n",
    "In the wake of this devastation, [Alex] and [Companion] are faced with the daunting task of navigating the labyrinthine corridors of their damaged vessel, assessing the extent of the destruction, and devising a plan to effect repairs before their life support systems fail completely. With each passing moment, the cold void of space looms ever closer, underscoring the urgency of their mission and the dire consequences of failure.\n",
